          <h2>Indian Revolutionary Freedom Fighter</h2>
          <p>
            <b> ☛ Bhagat Singh Sandhu(27 September 1907[1] – 23 March 1931) was a
              charismatic Indian revolutionary. <br><br>
              ☛Bhagat Singh was an Indian
              revolutionary freedom fighter who was hanged to death by British
              colonisers at the age of 23 years.  <br><br>
              ☛Fondly known as 'Shaheed
              (martyr) Bhagat Singh', he is considered a national hero of
              India's freedom struggle against colonial rule. <br><br>
              ☛ As a teenager,Bhagat Singh popularised the slogan of ‘Inquilab Zindabad’ which
              eventually became the catchphrase of the Indian independence movement <br><br>
              ☛.As his family was deeply inspired by nationalism, he too
              became actively involved in the country's freedom movements. <br><br>
              ☛ He quit education at the age of thirteen and got admitted to the
              National College in Lahore, where he studied European
              revolutionary movements.  <br><br>
              ☛ When his parents tried to get him  married, Bhagat Singh left home for Kanpur.  <br><br>
              ☛ In 1926, Bhagat Singhestablished the 'Naujavan Bharat Sabha (Youth Society of India)
              and joined the Hindustan Republican Association (later known as
              Hindustan Socialist Republican Association). <br><br>
              ☛ During that time, he met many anti-colonial activists.
              ☛ In December 1928, Bhagat Singh, along with Sukhdev and Rajguru, planned to avenge the death of
              Indian nationalist leader Lala Lajpat Rai and plotted to
              assassinate the Superintendent of Police James Scott in Lahore. <br><br>
              ☛ However, in a case of mistaken identity, John Saunders, the
              Assistant Superintendent of Police was shot. <br><br>
              ☛ To avoid being recognised and arrested for the crime, Bhagat Singh escaped from
              Lahore to Calcutta after shaving his beard and cutting his hair. <br><br>
              ☛ In April 1929, Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt bombed the Central
              Assembly Hall in Delhi, and shouted the slogan of “Inquilab Zindabad!”. 
              ☛He was later arrested after the incident. <br><br>
